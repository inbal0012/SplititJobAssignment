I haven't finished everything, 
I'll admit most of my time went on remembering C#, and .Net Core syntaxes.
here's an example of a scraper I built about 2 years ago, for myself.
It's a scraper for alcohol prices, and I've configured it to 8 different sites.
hope this will give you another look at my abilities.
